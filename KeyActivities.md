  **Will the company be developing physical or digital products?**
  
  Our company plans to release both digital and physical product in order to appease both halves of the customer base.

  **Is there going to be a platform for customers to use?**
  
  We will be monitoring customer comments on both our own webpage and our page on steam in order to respond to problems with the game and have a good relationship with customers.


**What are the key resources the company is required?**

  As a game studio, developers with knowledge and the love for their duties, a few computers with high enough
specs to run basic applications and the funding to hire people to fill the roles we cannot provide on our own such as
music composition and art. Resources required would be a composer and artist as well as a server for our website and potentially someone 
to help advertise.
  
**What computing and communications equipment and software are required?**

Our company will require computers and software that will allow our developers to perform their task without any interruptions. As for 
software, the requirement might be variable, the decision is based on which engines/art software are being used for the creation of our 
product.
