  **Will the company be developing physical or digital products?**
  
  Our company plans to release digital products on the Steam application and potentially roll out physical copies to stores later if the game does well. 

  **Is there going to be a platform for customers to use?**
  
  We will be monitoring customer comments on both our own webpage and our page on steam in order to respond to problems with the game and have a good relationship with customers.


**What are the key resources required?**

  As a game studio, developers with knowledge and the love for their duties, a few computers with high enough
specs to run basic applications and the funding to hire people to fill the roles we cannot provide on our own such as
music composition and art. Resources required would be a composer and artist, a server for our website, the intellectual property of the game's concept story and characters, enough money to hire freelancers and potentially someone to help advertise.
  
**What computing and communications equipment and software are required?**

Our company will require computers and software that will allow our developers to perform their task without any interruptions or lag
likely only costing about $1000-$1500 a piece. As for software, since we will only be providing for programmers and hiring freelancers for
art and composition we would need the Unreal engine some type of communication service such as Slack. Finally we will need a small server
to run our website we would likely just get one along with the domain name from a service such as SquareSpace.
