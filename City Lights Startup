I think as with most indie game projects our project doesn't have a guarantee to be viable, but there are certain things that could be 
done to increase our viability. I don't think renting an office would be required for the first while until we were sure we would be 
making the money for it, especially since we only would start with a handful of employees. We could also switch from steam to the epic 
games store. If we did that we would make the 30% cut into a 12% cut and remove the cost of the Unreal engine, however, it is impossible 
to know how this would affect our number of sales. Speaking of sales numbers it is rather difficult to make accurate predictions of how 
well indie games will sell. I have chosen my numbers for the first game as numbers far below the average for indie games because the 
number is pulled up so much by games with huge successes in the millions of sales. It is far from impossible for our game to sell much 
better than I projected especially if we advertise it well, but it is also very possible it flops entirely and we go out of business right 
then and there or take some massive budget cuts. Overall, it is difficult to assess exactly how our game will fair, however, if we work 
hard enough I think it is possible to make a name for ourselves and succeed as a company.
