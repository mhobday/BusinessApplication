**Key activities:**
The most imporatant activities for our company to achieve it's value propisition will be advertising our product and producing our game.
We will maintain our website and manage the steam page's and our website's comment sections in order to respond to customer problems and 
fix any bugs that may have been missed in testing and establish a positive relationship with our customers. 

**Key resources:**
The only physical asset we will need is enough computers for our small team to use non-demanding programs to write the game. Human 
resources will be writers for the story, artists for the backgrounds and character art, programmers for the game and composers for the 
soundtrack. We would also require the intellectual property of the characters and plot. Financial assets would be minimal mostly just 
money to pay people to do sound/art which would likely be out of pocket and unrelated to the company.

**Information Technology Platform:**
As said earlier our hardware would be limited to a few computers for our local programmers to use. The software we would need would be the
game a small server for our website and a way to contact eachother likely Discord or a similar application.
