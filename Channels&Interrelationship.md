**How will we raise customer awareness?**
Since it will be difficult to get through steam greenlight we will need to work hard to get out game out there before it goes to Steam. We will have a trailer for the game on our personal website, we will enter it into as many indie game competitions as possible, send it for free to let's players and game journalism sites, write about it ourselves on social media and encourage our friends and family to do the same. We will post frequent updates on social media and our website and do a reddit AMA when it is nearly finished. Hopefully with thoose things together we will gain enough popularity to get our game onto Steam.

**How could the customer reach out to the company and how does the company provide support to the customer?**
  
Since our plan is to launch our first game on Steam, our customers could reach out to our company by leaving comment on our developer page, or through the contact information listed on our company website. From there we could offer tech support or fix any bugs or issues that they may point out in the game.

**How could the customer evalute what the company offers? How could the customer purchase the product?**

Throughout development of the game we will be posting art assets, music, screenshots, and teaser trailers as we finish them to get people excited and to help them see if they would want the game. Just before the official launch of the game, our development team will release a full trailer of our game, so any potential customers who haven't been following development can decide if they would be interested in our game. When the game is released on Steam, our customers will be able to purchase our product through Steam, and even before that it will be available through our company website.

**What type of relationship does our company have with customers?**

Our company will pay close attention to customer satisfaction through Steam's feedback systems namely reviews, and comments on our product's page. Since we expect our first game to be rather small, we will try to have a close relationship with fans responding to issues and reviews in a quick and friendly way with human written responses in an effort make fans like the developers not just the game.
