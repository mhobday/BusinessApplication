**Provide an overview of the company's customer segment with much detail as possible** (Summarize the customer segment analysis?)\
Us here at City Lights want our first game audience to be high schoolers about to enter college to college graduates who can still remember the horrors of college, or for those who wish to expeience college life for better or worse

**Online-Service Description, how is the company planning to take the first step in the online market? What are we
  the company aiming for? what are the path the company used to deliver it's product or service?**
 Our plan for our first step in the online market would be to sell our game through a client like Steam in order to reach a wider audience. With the success of our first game we would be able to easily sell higher priced games that have had more time for polishing and longer games. We would use the Steam client or something similar to distribute our first game but as we grow we would start selling our game from our official site.
 
**After all, where is our company in five years? is the company going to take a step in another market or focus on a single path? By that
  time, how are the product/service the company provides to it's customer change? what are the reason behind the change?**
In five years, we see our company has grown greatly with a higher reputation and selling bigger and better games then ever before. We would mostly stay within our current path of game development but we would also like to take some steps into the merch market for our games. Within the five years our company would focus on making longer and more content filled games with less initial bugs and more fun and exciting game play.
